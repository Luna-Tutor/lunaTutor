# lunaTutor

Luna tutor was created for the 2020 NASA SpaceApps Challenge in Seattle.

2020 has been a difficult year for everyone, but it has been especially hard on K-12 students new to remote learning who have had to adapt to a new
way of learning in a short amount of time. With teachers not as accessible as they are able to be inside a classroom, we feared that students were in
need of an additional place to ask their science-related questions. This is what inspired us to create lunatutor, a space where anyone can ask and
answer questions relating to science.

## NASA Datasets Used

- We used NASA's
  [Learning, Racism & Inequality](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/hq/eodm/documents_resources/resources_for_learning_and_talking_about_racism_and_inequality)
  resources to continue learning about systemic issues and how different people experience inequality. This helped us to identify an issue happening
  now during the pandemic where students of different races and socioeconomic backgrounds are expected to accomplish the same work as other students
  while not having the same access to resources. Thus, leading us in the first step of Unity. We implemented the
  [NASA Unity Campagin's](https://www.nasa.gov/offices/odeo/nasaunity) mission statement of "Mission and Team above Self" to make an attempt at
  solving this issue.
